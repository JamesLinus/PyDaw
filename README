== About ==
PyFlp is a python library to mess with FL Studio project files.

Currently it is read only and only has useful functions for determining
the dependencies of an .flp file, because that's all I need it for at 
the moment.

However the loading already knows a LOT more information about the project.
In fact it knows pretty much everything about it and just needs some numbers
to be cleaned up in order for the information to be useful. In other words,
adding more functionality to this library would be pretty easy.

In the future I hope to provide editing and saving support.

== Installation ==

python setup.py build
sudo python setup.py install

== Example usage ==

    import flp

    f = flp.new("files/HeretoMove_20.flp")

    if f.good():
        print("Good!")

        print("Beats per minute: %i" % f.tempo())
        print("Project title: %s" % f.title())
        print("Project version: %s" % f.versionString())

        print("\nChannels:\n---------")
        for i in range(f.channelCount()):
            print("%s (%s)" % (f.channelName(i), f.channelPluginName(i)))
        
        print("\nSamples:\n----------")
        for i in range(f.sampleCount()):
            print(f.sampleFileName(i))

        print("\nEffects:\n----------")
        for i in range(f.effectCount()):
            print(f.effectPluginName(i))
    else:
        print("Error: %s" % f.errorMessage())
